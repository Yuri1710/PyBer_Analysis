# PyBer_Analysis
## Project PyBer App
###### Object:
**Analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May 2019 from our PyBer app.**

*Our main purpose for these project is to create visualization for our CEO since our app is extremely demanding and we would like to provide improvements for the application.*

## Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

Please see below our mean, median and mode amount per type:

Our highest mean is on our "Urban" sector, secondly "Suburban and finally "Rural" with an 6.94.

Therefore we have better rates in our rural area, however, derived from risk we have fewer operators being a total of 78. Although our rate is lower in the urban area we have more than 30 times of operators in our urban area, being a total of 2405.  Finally we can see that we also have greater demand for travel requests in our urban area.

Please consider our monthly Fare (USD), having better profits at the end of February and at the end of April:

## Business Recommendations.

Based on our numbers, we recommend to increase the rate in our urban area according to the fact that we have greater demand and achieve better profit.
2. Launch a promotion for our sector "Suburban", since according to the demand of total travel, we need more operators.
3. Make publicity in our "Rural" area, so that the public knows that PyBer has service anywhere in the USA, and increase our rides.
